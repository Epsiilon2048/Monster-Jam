As the Divine Creature, your goal is to avoid the humans until you can collect enough orbs to
take your true form, whereupon you will wreak havoc. Darkness is your refuge!

As a human, your goal is to entrap and aprehend the creature. You are equipped with concussive
remote bombs, scanners, and flashlights to accomplish your task. You may also decide to light
torches around the station, though you will be vulnerable while carrying one. If the creature 
manages to take its true form, run!
