// Integration //
 - If you want to start the game displaying a variable or doing anything else with the console, put it in
   the console_startup script. It's automatically run at the end of the console's create event.

// Console help //
By default, the console key is tab. You can change this by changing the console_key variable.
You can also press shift+tab to quickely pull up the help menu.

This console operates in scopes. You can change the scope to a certain object by entering its name, or
you can type "object.variable" to access variables within objects outside of your scope, as it is in GML.
